            To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, UniqueRewards has used appropriate and standard industry procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Such information includes the nature of your firewall, encryption, token authentication, application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our network and its data.

            The UniqueRewards web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the company, UniqueRewards.com, is not responsible for the privacy practices of such linked sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

            Opting-Out:
            </span>
            </p><p class="sp">
            Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new offers or special promotions from UniqueRewards -- if they have not opted out. By "opting-out" the user indicates that he or she does not wish to receive such e-mails from UniqueRewards.com. The opt-out can be performed upon initial registration or later. You may optout of receiving these newsletters at any time by updating your account information in the UniqueRewards "My Profile" section. You can reach the "My Profile" section by clicking on the "My Profile" button in the main user's menu. When you reach this page, uncheck the box that reads, "Yes, I want to receive special cash offers".
            </p><p class="sp">
            When a member receives a special offer or promotion e-mail from UniqueRewards.com and decides that he or she no longer wishes to receive such e-mails, the member can open the e-mail and scroll to the bottom. At the bottom of the e-mail page there will be a brief description of how to have an account "opted-out". Once UniqueRewards receives information regarding these account changes the company will make the specified changes as soon as possible.

            Under rare circumstances UniqueRewards.com may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcement about the UniqueRewards site or service changes. Members are not able to unsubscribe, or "opt-out" of these announcements, because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, UniqueRewards will post information regarding changes directly on the web site. UniqueRewards.com reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information UniqueRewards deems relevant.

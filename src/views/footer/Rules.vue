            1) Terms of Offers
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            UniqueRewards.com displays Offers on this Website from many different third party companies (collectively,
            "Advertisers"). UniqueRewards.com does not provide the Offers, and only Advertisers are responsible for their
            individual Offers. UniqueRewards.com is not responsible for the Terms and Conditions of any of the Offers
            listed on our Website. Users should carefully read all of the Terms and Conditions of an Offer before
            completing it. UniqueRewards.com is not responsible for any billing or ensuing contracts or relations between
            Users and Advertisers. UniqueRewards.com does not have contact information for Advertisers. Users should
            contact Advertisers directly for all questions or disputes relating to the Offer.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Some Offers provide rewards to Users in addition to the Cash offered by UniqueRewards.com, such as Gift Cards,
            Free Gas, Digital Cameras, and others. These rewards are provided by the Advertisers and not
            UniqueRewards.com. Often times, Users must meet requirements that are not necessary to receive Cash rewards
            from UniqueRewards.com in order to qualify for the additional rewards. Users should be sure to read all of the
            Terms of the Offer to determine what those requirements are. UniqueRewards.com is not responsible for these
            additional rewards.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            There are times when Advertisers change the Terms of an Offer without notifying us. Therefore,
            UniqueRewards.com makes no guarantees on the accuracy of the Offer descriptions listed on our Website. In
            addition, if an Advertiser changes the payout of an Offer, the User may receive a lower amount of Cash than
            what was indicated at the time they completed the Offer.
          </p>
          <p class="sp25">
            2) Offer Completion
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Users may complete an Offer only if they have not completed the Offer in the past, either through
            UniqueRewards.com, any other website, or with the Advertiser. Users will not be credited for completing an
            Offer if they have already completed the Offer in the past.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Users must complete the Offer by clicking on the Offer from our Web Site and completing all of the Offer
            requirements as given by the Advertiser. The User must not return to the Advertiser's Web Site at a later date
            or complete the Offer via telephone, as this interferes with our ability to track offer completion.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Users must ensure their Web Browser is set to allow all Cookies to ensure proper tracking occurs. In addition,
            Users should ensure they do not have anti-virus and/or anti-spyware software running that is set to override
            the Browser's Cookie settings or any software provided by us.

          <p class="sp25">
            3) Offer Crediting
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Most Offers are credited to the User's UniqueRewards.com Account within 24 to 72 hours after completion;
            however, some Offers can take up to 30 days to credit. The amount of time an Offer takes to credit is solely
            dependent on the Advertiser, and UniqueRewards.com is not responsible for this delay. Users should read and
            comply with all of the Offer requirements to ensure timely credit.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            UniqueRewards.com does not guarantee a User will receive credit for completing an Offer. The Advertiser has
            the final say in whether or not a User receives credit. Only if and when UniqueRewards.com receives credit
            from the Advertiser, then we will issue credit to the User; however, if the Advertiser fails to issue credit
            to UniqueRewards.com, we cannot credit the User.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Users should save all Confirmation Emails received from Advertisers after completing an Offer. Often times
            those Emails can be used to manually credit the User's Account.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Many of the Offers listed on UniqueRewards.com include a free trial so that Users can evaluate the product or
            service without cost. Users should not complete the Offer unless they have a genuine interest in the product
            or service. Canceling a free trial immediately after joining may interfere with our tracking and may result in
            not being credited or having credit revoked. Moreover, completing and subsequently canceling a large number of
            free trial Offers may be grounds for non-payment, in the sole discretion of UniqueRewards.com and the
            associated Advertisers. We may also terminate an Account or deny credit of Cash, in addition to any other
            legal remedy, in the event a User's activity appears fraudulent or that participation in Offers is a sham, in
            our sole discretion.

            transactions.<br>
            Most Purchases are credited to the User's UniqueRewards.com Account within 24 to 48 hours after completion;
            The Advertisers have the final say in whether or not the User is credited. Therefore, UniqueRewards.com does
            not guarantee Users will be credited for participating in the Cashback Shopping program.

            REDEEM THE "CASH" IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION TO PAY YOU WHATSOEVER, UNLESS AND
            UNTIL YOU HAVE ACCRUED AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT IN YOUR ACCOUNT. UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU HAVE ACCRUED
            THE MINIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT, SUCH "CASH" IS DEEMED A CONTINGENT LIABILITY, THAT IS ENTIRELY CONTINGENT UPON:
            (1) YOUR ACCRUAL OF AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND (2) YOUR FULL COMPLIANCE WITH
            THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. UNLESS AND UNTIL YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE REACHES THE MINIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT, THE
            "CASH" IN YOUR ACCOUNT HAS NO CASH VALUE.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH AN INITIAL BALANCE OF FIVE DOLLARS ($5.00), AND THEN ACCRUE ANOTHER
            TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) IN CASH IN YOUR ACCOUNT, FOR A TOTAL OF $15.00, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANY
            PAYMENT, AND WE ARE NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY AMOUNT. IN THIS EXAMPLE YOU WOULD HAVE TO EARN YET FIVE DOLLARS
            ($5.00), FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY DOLLARS ($20.00) ACCRUED BALANCE, BEFORE YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO ANY PAYMENT.
          </p>
          <p class="sp25">
            3) Requesting Payment
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            The minimal payment amount is $20.00<br>
            To request payment, click the "Request Payment" link in the "Balance" section of your account. We'll pay you
            through PayPal, Bitcoins and by check. You'll be able to choose the most suitable method for you.
          </p>
          <p class="sp25">
            4) Payment Schedule
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Our members are paid on a weekly basis, each Monday. For example, if you order money on Tuesday, your earnings
            will be sent on the following Monday evening.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            All payments are inspected immediately prior to processing. Payment requests belonging to Users who have
            duplicate Accounts will not be processed and will be removed, and corresponding Cash in the Account will be
            forfeit.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            UniqueRewards may delay the payment for some time if there is a suspicion that the completed offers/surveys
            might be reversed by the advertiser.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            If some delays with payments occur, UniqueRewards posts information about delays on <a

            5) Returns and Reversals
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            Any time you return a Cashback Shopping purchased item for which you received Cash in your Account, and any
            time you void, cancel, rescind, or reverse any Cash Shopping transaction for which you received Cash in your
            Account, UniqueRewards.com will subtract a corresponding amount of Cash from your Account. Similarly, if any
            Advertiser notifies us that it is reversing its transaction with you for any reason on any of our Cash
            generating activities, we will subtract a corresponding amount of Cash from your Account.
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            If your Account receives a reversal and is suspected of fraudulent activity, UniqueRewards shall have the
            right to block your Account until the circumstances are clarified.

            6) Fraud Prevention
          </p>
          <p class="sp">
            UniqueRewards.com reserves the right to request further information from Users to ensure they have not
            fraudulently completed offers or participated in offers with no intent to ultimately go through or honor the
            offer. This information may include, but is not limited to, a copy of the credit card statement that was used
            to complete the offers, in order to ensure a stolen credit card was not used.
          </p>
          <p class="sp25">
            In order to ensure that the users are from allowed countries, i.e. from the USA, Canada, and the UK,
            UniqueRewards.com reserves the right to ask users to request their first payment by check.

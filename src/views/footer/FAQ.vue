                Your account is credited for completing Cash Offer as soon as the advertiser reports the transaction to
                UniqueRewards. For most Cash Offers, this process occurs within 12 to 48 hours. Some Cash Offers with
                extended delayed report can take up to 30 days to credit to your account. If more than 30 days have passed
                since completing a Cash Offer and you have still not been credited, please send us a confirmation email from
                the offer and our support team will assist you further.

                <p>Offers sometimes fail to credit. This can be due to many reasons, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser's refusal to accept cookies
                </li>
                <li>Security measures set by the operating system or other software such as popup blockers
                </li>
                <li>Ad-blocking software, on your computer or enforced by your employer, school, or network
                    administrator.
                </li>
                <li>Adware/malware/spyware which can "hijack" affiliate links so that the software publisher gets credit
                    instead.
                </li>
                <li>Your have forgotten to click on a confirmation link from completed offer.
                </li>
                <li>Just plain bad luck -- occasionally you may do everything right and simply not get credited.
                </li>
                <li>Unfortunately, the system is not perfect (but it's the best we can do).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have previously completed the Cash Offer (either through another web site or with the advertiser
                directly), you will not be credited for completing the Cash Offer through UniqueRewards.
            </p>
            <p class="sp">
                In order to minimize the risk of these problems occurring, please:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temporarily disable any ad-blocking software while using UniqueRewards.
                </li>
                <li>Clear your cookies and cache before logging in to Uniquerewards.

            <li>Enable Cookies<br>
                Our tracking relies on cookies to function. If you do not have cookies enabled, our stores will not know
                you made your purchase through UniqueRewards . This means that the store will not be able to notify
                UniqueRewards of your purchase and we will not be able to give you credit for your purchase.<br>
                Please make sure that your security software (anti-virus software) does not override this feature.

            </li>
            <li>Enable Pop-ups<br>
                Store websites typically open in new browser windows for your convenience. Thus, you need to have popups
                enabled for the Cashback Shopping section to function properly.<br>
                Please make sure that your security software (anti-virus software) does not override this feature.

            </li>
            <li>Do Not Bookmark<br>
                You cannot bookmark the store website and return later to make your purchase because you will go
                directly to the store's site rather than being directed there as a member of UniqueRewards. This means
                that the store will not be able to notify UniqueRewards of your purchase and we will not be able to give
                you credit for your purchase.

            <li>Complete Spyware Scan<br>
                Make sure you are not infected with Spyware. One of the main features of Spyware applications is to
                "hijack" referral information. For example, if you click on a store from the UniqueRewards Cashback
                Shopping page and are infected with Spyware, the Spyware application overwrites our tracking information
                with their own. Thus, the creator of the Spyware application is credited for the transaction and thus we
                are unable to credit you.

                When you choose a store listed on Cashback Shopping, you are directed to that store's website, which is
                separate from UniqueRewards. The coupons listed on UniqueRewards are subject to the terms and conditions

                coupons.<br>

                Your account is credited for completing a Survey as soon as the advertiser reports the transaction to

                completing a Survey. Some Surveys with extended delayed report can take up to 30 days to credit to your
                account. If more than 30 days have passed since completing a Survey and you have still not been
                credited, please tell us about it and we will credit your account.

                We have an Unique Referall's System:<br>
                1. We pay $1 when each of your referral completes his/her first offer.<br>
                Any easiest offer! Even if its cost is only $0.10!<br>
                2. We pay $5 for every active referral!<br>
                It means that every time when one of your referrals earns $20 or more gets the "active" status and you
                also earn $5! Just once for one referral.<br>
                3. We pay 10% of the Qualified Earnings received by your referrals! For your lifetime!

                    You may have to refresh/reload your website for the banner to appear.
